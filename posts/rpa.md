**Robotic process automation**  (or RPA) is a form of  [business process automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_automation "Business process automation")  technology based on metaphorical  [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software "Software")  robots (bots) or on  [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence")  (AI)/digital workers.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation#cite_note-NewScientistAI-1)  It is sometimes referred to as  _software robotics_  (not to be confused with  [robot software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_software "Robot software")).

In traditional  [workflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow "Workflow")  [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation "Automation")  tools, a  [software developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer "Software developer")  produces a list of actions to automate a task and interface to the back-end system using internal  [application programming interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interfaces "Application programming interfaces")  (APIs) or dedicated  [scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language "Scripting language"). In contrast, RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the application's  [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface")  (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.

RPA tools have strong technical similarities to  [graphical user interface testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface_testing "Graphical user interface testing")  tools. These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by  [repeating a set of demonstration actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_by_demonstration "Programming by demonstration")  performed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems in that they allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving  [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email "Email")  containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a  [bookkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookkeeping "Bookkeeping")  system.
