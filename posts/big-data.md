(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set "Data set")  that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional  [data-processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing "Data processing")  [application software]

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software"). Data with many cases (rows) offer greater  [statistical power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power "Statistical power"), while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher  [false discovery rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate "False discovery rate").[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#cite_note-2)  Big data challenges include  [capturing data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_and_data_capture "Automatic identification and data capture"),  [data storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage "Computer data storage"),  [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis "Data analysis"), search,  [sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sharing "Data sharing"),  [transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission "Data transmission"),  [visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization "Data visualization"),  [querying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language "Query language"), updating,  [information privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy "Information privacy")  and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts:  _volume_,  _variety_, and  _velocity_. When we handle big data, we may not sample but simply observe and track what happens. Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and  _value._

Current usage of the term  _big data_  tends to refer to the use of  [predictive analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics "Predictive analytics"),  [user behavior analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_behavior_analytics "User behavior analytics"), or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. "There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem."[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#cite_note-3)  Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to "spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#cite_note-Economist-4)  Scientists, business executives, medical practitioners, advertising and  [governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_database "Government database")  alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including  [Internet searches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine "Web search engine"),  [fintech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech "Fintech"), urban informatics, and  [business informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_informatics "Business informatics"). Scientists encounter limitations in  [e-Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Science "E-Science")  work, including  [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"),  [genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics "Genomics"),[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#cite_note-5)  [connectomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectomics "Connectomics"), complex physics simulations, biology and environmental research.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#cite_note-6)

**Data sets grow rapidly**, to a certain extent because they are increasingly gathered by cheap and numerous information-sensing  [Internet of things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things "Internet of things")  devices such as  [mobile devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device "Mobile device"), aerial ([remote sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing "Remote sensing")), software logs,  [cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera "Digital camera"), microphones,  [radio-frequency identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification "Radio-frequency identification")  (RFID) readers and  [wireless sensor networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_sensor_networks "Wireless sensor networks").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#cite_note-8)  The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#cite_note-martinhilbert.net-9)  as of 2012, every day 2.5  [exabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte "Exabyte")  (2.5Ã—260  bytes) of data are generated.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#cite_note-10)  Based on an  [IDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Corporation "International Data Corporation")  report prediction, the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4.4  [zettabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettabyte "Zettabyte")  to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#cite_note-11)  One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#cite_note-12)

**Relational database management systems**(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system "Relational database management system"), desktop  [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics")[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_]  and software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty handling big data. The work may require "massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers".[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data#cite_note-13)  What qualifies as being "big data" varies depending on the capabilities of the users and their tools, and expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. "For some organizations, facing hundreds of  [gigabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte "Gigabyte")  of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration."
