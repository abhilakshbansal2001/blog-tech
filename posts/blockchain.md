A  **blockchain**,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-fortune20160515-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-nyt20160521-3)  originally  **block chain**,[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-primer-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-obmh-5)  is a growing list of  [records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science) "Record (computer science)"), called  _blocks_, that are linked using  [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cryptocurrencytech-6)  Each block contains a  [cryptographic hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function "Cryptographic hash function")  of the previous block,[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cryptocurrencytech-6)  a  [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping "Trusted timestamping"), and transaction data (generally represented as a  [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree "Merkle tree")).

By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open,  [distributed ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger "Distributed ledger")  that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-hbr201701-7)  For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a  [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer "Peer-to-peer")  network collectively adhering to a  [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(communication) "Protocol (communication)")  for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered  [secure by design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design "Secure by design")  and exemplify a distributed computing system with high  [Byzantine fault tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance "Byzantine fault tolerance").  [Decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized "Decentralized")  consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-decapp-8)

Blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name  [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto "Satoshi Nakamoto")  in 2008 to serve as the public transaction  [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger "Ledger")  of the  [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency "Cryptocurrency")  [bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin "Bitcoin").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1)  The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the  [double-spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending "Double-spending")  problem without the need of a trusted authority or central  [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)"). The bitcoin design has inspired other applications,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-1)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-nyt20160521-3)  and blockchains that are readable by the public are widely used by  [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrencies "Cryptocurrencies"). Blockchain is considered a type of  [payment rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_rail "Payment rail").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-9)  Private blockchains have been proposed for business use.  _Computerworld_  called the marketing of such blockchains without a proper security model "[snake oil](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/snake_oil "wiktionary:snake oil")".
