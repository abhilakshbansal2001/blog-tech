**Virtual reality**  (**VR**) is a  [simulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation "Simulation")  experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world.  [Applications of virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_virtual_reality "Applications of virtual reality")  can include entertainment (i.e.  [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game "Video game")) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training). Other, distinct types of VR style technology include  [augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality "Augmented reality")  and  [mixed reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality "Mixed reality"), sometimes referred to as  [extended reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_reality "Extended reality")  or XR.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality#cite_note-1)

Currently standard virtual reality systems use either  [virtual reality headsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset "Virtual reality headset")  or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a  [head-mounted display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-mounted_display "Head-mounted display")  with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates  [auditory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_feedback "Auditory feedback")  and  [video feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_feedback "Video feedback"), but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through  [haptic technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology "Haptic technology").
